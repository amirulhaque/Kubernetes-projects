# 🚀 Kubernetes - The Container Orchestration Platform

## 🌐 1. What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (a.k.a **K8s**) is an **open-source container orchestration platform**.  
- Originally designed by **Google**, now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.  
- **Purpose**: Automate the deployment, scaling, networking, and management of containerized applications.

💡 **Without Kubernetes**: You’d have to run, stop, scale, and update containers manually.  
💡 **With Kubernetes**: You declare what you want (e.g., *“I want 5 replicas of my app”*), and Kubernetes ensures it.

## ⚡ 2. Why Kubernetes?

- **Scalability** → Scale applications up or down easily.  
- **High availability** → Your app stays up even if some nodes fail.  
- **Self-healing** → Automatically restarts crashed pods.  
- **Load balancing** → Distributes traffic across pods.  
- **Rolling updates & rollbacks** → Zero downtime deployments.  
- **Portability** → Works on AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises.

## 🏗️ 3. Kubernetes Architecture

A **Kubernetes cluster** = **Control Plane** + **Worker Nodes**

### 🧠 Control Plane (Brain)
- **API Server** → Entry point for all `kubectl` / REST commands.  
- **etcd** → Key-value store that keeps cluster state.  
- **Scheduler** → Decides which node a Pod will run on.  
- **Controller Manager** → Ensures desired state (e.g., *3 replicas must always run*).  
- **Cloud Controller Manager** → Integrates with cloud providers.  

### 💪 Worker Nodes (Muscles)
- **Kubelet** → Talks to API server, runs Pods on the node.  
- **Kube-proxy** → Manages networking/routing for Pods.  
- **Container Runtime** → (Docker, containerd, CRI-O) runs actual containers.  
- **Pod(s)** → The running container workloads.

## 📦 4. Kubernetes Core Concepts

### 🔹 Pod
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.  
- Encapsulates **1 or more containers** (usually one).  
- Example: An `nginx` container running in a pod.  

### 🔹 ReplicaSet
- Ensures a fixed number of Pod replicas are always running.  
- If a pod dies → ReplicaSet spawns a new one.  

### 🔹 Deployment
- Higher-level controller that manages ReplicaSets.  
- Provides **rolling updates**, **rollbacks**, and **scaling**.  
- Most commonly used for **stateless applications**.  

### 🔹 Service
- Provides stable networking for Pods (since Pods have dynamic IPs).  
- **Types**:  
  - `ClusterIP` → Accessible only inside the cluster (default).  
  - `NodePort` → Exposes on a port across all nodes.  
  - `LoadBalancer` → Exposes using cloud load balancers.  
  - `ExternalName` → Maps service to external DNS.  

### 🔹 ConfigMap & Secret
- **ConfigMap** → Stores **non-sensitive** configuration (key-value).  
- **Secret** → Stores **sensitive** data (passwords, tokens), base64 encoded.  

### 🔹 Namespace
- Provides **logical isolation** within a cluster.  
- Useful for separating environments: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`.  

### 🔹 Ingress
- Manages **external HTTP/HTTPS traffic**.  
- Acts like a **smart router** with rules for URLs/domains.  

### 🔹 Persistent Volume (PV) & Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
- **PV** → Actual physical storage (disk, NFS, cloud volume).  
- **PVC** → A request for storage by Pods.  
- Ensures storage is **not lost** when Pods restart.  

### 🔹 StatefulSet
- Like Deployment, but for **stateful apps** (databases, Kafka, etc.).  
- Provides **stable pod names**, **ordered deployments**, **persistent storage**.  

### 🔹 DaemonSet
- Ensures a pod runs on **every node**.  
- Example: Monitoring agent (**Prometheus Node Exporter**) or logging agent (**Fluentd**).

## ⚙️ 5. Kubernetes Networking

- Each Pod gets its **own IP address**.  
- Pods communicate via:  
  - **Pod-to-Pod** (within cluster)  
  - **Pod-to-Service** (via Service)  
  - **External-to-Service** (via NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress)  

- Networking handled by **CNI plugins**:  
  - Calico  
  - Flannel  
  - Cilium
